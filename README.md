# TasX

TasX is a task management application built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend connected to a MySQL database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MySQL

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TasX

    Navigate to the client folder and install dependencies:

    bash

cd client
npm install

Install backend dependencies:

Navigate back to the main folder:

bash

cd ..

Then install dependencies for the backend:

bash

    npm install

Database Setup     
Create a MySQL database named tasx.

    CREATE DATABASE tasx;



Create the tasks table.

Use the following SQL script to create the tasks table:

sql

    USE tasx;

    CREATE TABLE tasks (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      task VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      description TEXT,
      due_date DATE,
      completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    This script creates a table with columns for task details, completion status, and timestamps for when the task was created and last updated.

Running the Application

    Start the backend server:

    bash

node server.js

Start the frontend development server:

Navigate to the client folder:

bash

    cd client
    npm run dev
